            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">

                    <p>
                        I am an IoT and Robotics Engineering student with strong hands-on
                        experience in designing embedded systems that address
                        real-world challenges in healthcare monitoring, assistive technologies,
                        environmental sensing, and smart automation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My engineering philosophy emphasizes system reliability,
                        measurable performance, and deployment-readiness rather than
                        proof-of-concept prototypes. I actively focus on building systems
                        that can operate under real constraints such as limited power,
                        low-cost hardware, noisy sensor data, and unstable network conditions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Technically, my work spans the full stack of IoT and embedded system
                        development — starting from schematic design and PCB prototyping,
                        moving through embedded firmware development on ESP32 microcontrollers,
                        integrating digital and analog sensors, implementing MQTT-based
                        communication pipelines, and deploying machine learning models
                        for edge-level intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have authored and presented peer-reviewed research at IEEE
                        conferences, demonstrating my ability to conduct applied research,
                        analyze experimental data, and translate academic concepts into
                        working engineering systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am currently seeking international research opportunities,
                        scholarships, and remote engineering roles where I can contribute
                        to technically challenging projects with meaningful social impact.
